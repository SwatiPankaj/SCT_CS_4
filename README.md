This is my skill craft technology, fourth task: implementing a keylogger.
A keylogger (short for keystroke logger) is a type of software or hardware that secretly records all the keys pressed on a keyboard, often without the userâ€™s knowledge or consent. Keyloggers are commonly used for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data by tracking everything typed on a computer or mobile device.
